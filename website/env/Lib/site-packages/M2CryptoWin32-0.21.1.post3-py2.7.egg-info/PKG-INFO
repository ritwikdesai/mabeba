        Troubleshooting
        ---------------
        
        If you see an error like the following during install, then you [allegedly] 
        have an old version of setuptools::
        
            error: option --single-version-externally-managed not recognized
        
        This seems to happen consistently for me, under Windows, even though it
        *pip* seems to download the latest version of *setuptools* when you install it.
        
        To get around this, use the `--egg` option::
        
            C:\>pip install --egg M2CryptoWin32
